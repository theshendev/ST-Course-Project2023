The Golestan system is a very powerful and efficient platform designed to manage students' academic status, conduct classes, and facilitate class registration. Each student and professor is registered in the Golestan system upon joining the university. This system records the details of each individual. 
Additionally, various classes are defined within the Golestan system, and each student can enroll in a selection of these classes. Professors input grades into the Golestan system, and students can also view their grades in this system.

For all possible cases within the functions under test, we write multiple test cases and then generate random data to automatically execute these test cases and assess code coverage. The steps for executing tests and additional explanations are included as comments in the test code.

To ensure that the functions under test are working correctly, we create several different test cases. Each of these test cases examines a different scenario, such as valid inputs, invalid inputs, and boundary inputs. We also write test cases that generate random data and pass these values to the functions. This helps us confirm that the functions perform correctly under various conditions.

After writing the test cases, we execute them automatically to evaluate them quickly and efficiently, ensuring that the functions perform correctly in all situations. We then use these test cases for coverage testing. This means we ensure that each line in the functions is covered by at least one test case, making certain that our functions are fully tested and error-free.

Finally, we use mutation testing to:


  1) Identify potential bugs that may not be detected by traditional testing techniques, like black-box and white-box testing.
  
  2) Improve the quality of the code.
  
  3) Increase the code's reliability.
  
  4) Reduce the costs of code development and maintenance.
